# Incorrectness Logic

This is a formalisation of "Incorrectness Logic" by Peter W. Oâ€™Hearn (http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/p.ohearn/papers/IncorrectnessLogic.pdf) in Lean.

It includes an encoding of the exmple language, encoding the semantics of Incorrectness tripples, and the proof of the major results in the paper.

Feel free to use this work as you wish, though if you do please let me know as I would be curious to know what for!
